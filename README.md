# csharp_Random_Unique_Number
random numbers and the numbers need to be unique the order of the returned numbers needs to be random.The range of random numbers is specified by Random.Next(), which returns values in the [0 .. Int32.MaxValue) range (note, it excludes Int32.MaxValue). The range is configurable, and 'small'.  If the range should be configurable, then the recommended algorithm would potentially be much larger.  Based on those assumptions, let's do a code review...
